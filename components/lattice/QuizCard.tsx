// total run time is dominated by this speed-scaled auto-answer delay (see
// lib/useChatFlow.ts + components/OnboardingChat.tsx), on top of a fixed
// ~10.7s "Building your report" checklist (components/GeneratingChecklist.tsx)
// that speed cannot touch at all.
//
// 3 is also the CEILING: demoSpeed is clamped to { min: 0.25, max: 3 } at
// OnboardingChat.tsx:97 and PlanFlow.tsx:133, so any larger value here is
// silently ignored. An earlier version of this comment claimed 6 "raced the
// funnel to completion" — it never did, because 6 was never in effect.
//
// This value has NOT been tuned against a real visible browser. Automated
// capture cannot measure it: the progress badge and auto-scroll are
// requestAnimationFrame-driven, so headless and background tabs render a
// frozen intro screen no matter how far the quiz has actually advanced. Tune
// this by watching a drill in a focused window, not from a screenshot.
